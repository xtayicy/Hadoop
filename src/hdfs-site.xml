	<property>
		<name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
		<value>/soft/hadoop-2.6.0/dir/data</value>
		<description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
			should store its blocks. If this is a comma-delimited
			list of
			directories, then data will be stored in all named
			directories,
			typically on different devices. The directories should be tagged
			with
			corresponding storage types ([SSD]/[DISK]/[ARCHIVE]/[RAM_DISK])
			for
			HDFS
			storage policies. The default storage type will be DISK if the
			directory
			does
			not have a storage type tagged explicitly. Directories
			that do not exist
			will
			be created if local filesystem permission
			allows.

	<property>
		<name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
		<value>/soft/hadoop-2.6.0/dir/name</value>
		<description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name
			node
			should store the name table(fsimage). If this is a comma-delimited list
			of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
			directories, for redundancy.
		</description>

	<property>
		<name>dfs.permissions.enabled</name>
		<value>false</value>
		<description>
			If "true", enable permission checking in HDFS.
			If "false",
			permission checking is turned off,
			but all other behavior is
			unchanged.
			Switching from one parameter value to the other does not
			change the mode,
			owner or group of files or directories.
